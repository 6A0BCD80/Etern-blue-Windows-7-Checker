# Etern-blue-Windows-7-Checker


This would basically send smb1 (not smb2) packets to determine if a machine is vulnerable to CVE-2017-0143 (Etern-Blue for windows).

Based on https://github.com/REPTILEHAUS/Eternal-Blue/blob/master/checker.py. The reason why I wrote this is, I wanted to see how the smb protocol works and how I would check for Etern-Blue exploit. I learned how to read wireshark packets and used it to create a program that checks if a Windows 7 machine is vulnerable to Eternal Blue exploit.
